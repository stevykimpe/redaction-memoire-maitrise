abstract = {The cervical spine is a highly flexible anatomy and therefore vulnerable to injuries. Unfortunately, a large number of injuries in lateral cervical X-ray images remain undiagnosed due to human errors. Computer-aided injury detection has the potential to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Towards building an automatic injury detection system, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based fully automatic framework for segmentation of cervical vertebrae in X-ray images. The framework first localizes the spinal region in the image using a deep fully convolutional neural network. Then vertebra centers are localized using a novel deep probabilistic spatial regression network. Finally, a novel shape-aware deep segmentation network is used to segment the vertebrae in the image. The framework can take an X-ray image and produce a vertebrae segmentation result without any manual intervention. Each block of the fully automatic framework has been trained on a set of 124 X-ray images and tested on another 172 images, all collected from real-life hospital emergency rooms. A Dice similarity coefficient of 0.84 and a shape error of 1.69 mm have been achieved.},

Patients suspected of cervical spine injuries are often imaged using lateral view radiographs. Incorrect diagnosis based on these images may lead to serious long-term consequences. Our overarching goal is to develop a computer-aided detection system to help an emergency room physician correctly diagnose a patient's injury. In this paper, we present a method to localize the corners of cervical vertebrae in a set of 90 lateral cervical radiographs. Haar-like features are computed using intensity and gradient image patches, each of which votes for possible corner position using a modified Hough forest regression technique. Votes are aggregated using two dimensional kernel density estimation, to find the location of the corner. Our method demonstrates promising results, identifying corners with an average median error of 2.08 mm.},

In image segmentation, shape has been widely used in segmentation methods, like the active shape model, to constrain a segmentation result to a class of learned shapes. However, to date, shape has been underutilized in deep segmentation networks. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a shape-aware term in the segmentation loss function. A deep convolutional network has been adapted in a novel cervical vertebrae segmentation framework and compared with traditional active shape model-based methods. The proposed framework has been trained on an augmented dataset of 26370 vertebrae and tested on 792 vertebrae collected from a total of 296 real-life emergency room lateral cervical X-ray images. The proposed framework achieved an average error of 1.11 pixels, signifying a 36{\%} improvement over the traditional methods. The introduction of the novel shape-aware term in the loss function significantly improved the performance by further 12{\%}, achieving an average error of only 0.99 pixel.},

abstract = {Corners hold vital information about size, shape and morphology of a vertebra in an x-ray image, and recent literature (Al-Arif et al., 2015) has shown promising performance for detecting vertebral corners using a Hough forest-based architecture. To provide spatial context, this method generates a set of 12 patches around a vertebra and uses a machine learning approach to predict corners of a vertebral body through a voting process. In this paper, we extend this framework in terms of patch generation and prediction methods. During patch generation, the square region of interest has been replaced with data-driven rectangular and trapezoidal region of interest which better aligns the patches to the vertebral body geometry, resulting in more discriminative feature vectors. The corner estimation or the prediction stage has been improved by utilising more efficient voting process using a single kernel density estimation. In addition, advanced and more complex feature vectors are introduced. We also present a thorough evaluation of the framework with different patch generation methods, forest training mechanisms and prediction methods. In order to compare the performance of this framework with a more general method, a novel multi-scale Harris corner detector-based approach is introduced that incorporates a spatial prior through a naive Bayes method. All these methods have been tested on a dataset of 90 X-ray images and achieved an average corner localization error of 2.01 mm, representing a 33{\%} improvement in localization accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art method (Al-Arif et al., 2015).},

From a training dataset, a non-linear regression model was trained using a deep neural network (DNN) in order to predict the displacement that recovers the optimal location of an anatomical landmark from an input image patch. Using a DNN for each landmark of a 2D simplified model of the spine, a detection sequence was able to localize the vertebral body centers and femoral heads. The whole process is regularized using a statistical shape model of a simplified model of the spine. The quantitative assessment on a set of 121 radiographs of scoliotic patients presented a mean localization errors of 3.5 ± 3.6 mm and 5.7 ± 6 mm respectively for the femoral heads and the vertebral body centers (vertebral levels T1 to L5). The mean error for the spinal curve automatic detection was 2 ± 2.8 mm, which is accurate enough to determine a first estimate of the spine 3D reconstruction in a 3D biplanar reconstruction scheme.},

The two vertebra contour detection methods include (1) a discrete dynamic contour model (DDCM) and (2) a template matching process associated with a polar signature system. These two methods not only enable vertebra segmentation but also extract parameters that can be used to evaluate vertebral mobility. Lateral cervical spine views including 100 views in flexion, extension and neutral orientations were available for evaluation. Vertebral body motion was evaluated by human observers and using automatic methods. Results : The results provided by the automated approaches were consistent with manual measures obtained by 15 human observers. Conclusion : The automated techniques provide acceptable results for the assessment of the vertebral body mobility in flexion and extension on lateral views of the cervical spine.},

Our application allows the use of two different models, that is, a global one (with several vertebrae) and a local one (with a single vertebra). Two modes of segmentation are also proposed: manual and semiautomatic. For the manual mode, only two points are selected by the user on a given image. The first point needs to be close to the lower anterior corner of the last vertebra and the second near the upper anterior corner of the first vertebra. These two points are required to initialize the segmentation process. We propose to use the Harris corner detector combined with three successive filters to carry out the semiautomatic process. The results obtained on a large set of X-ray images are very promising.},

We propose a segmentation approach based on Active Shape Model method whose main advantage is that it uses a statistical model. This model is created by training it with sample images on which the boundaries of the object of interest are annotated by an expert. The specialist knowledge is very useful in this context. This model represents the local statistics around each landmark. Our application allows the manipulation of a vertebra model. The results obtained are very promising.},

abstract = {In histopathological image analysis, the morphology of histological structures, such as glands and nuclei, has been routinely adopted by pathologists to assess the malignancy degree of adenocarcinomas. Accurate detection and segmentation of these objects of interest from histology images is an essential prerequisite to obtain reliable morphological statistics for quantitative diagnosis. While manual annotation is error-prone, time-consuming and operator-dependant, automated detection and segmentation of objects of interest from histology images can be very challenging due to the large appearance variation, existence of strong mimics, and serious degeneration of histological structures. In order to meet these challenges, we propose a novel deep contour-aware network (DCAN) under a unified multi-task learning framework for more accurate detection and segmentation. In the proposed network, multi-level contextual features are explored based on an end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN) to deal with the large appearance variation. We further propose to employ an auxiliary supervision mechanism to overcome the problem of vanishing gradients when training such a deep network. More importantly, our network can not only output accurate probability maps of histological objects, but also depict clear contours simultaneously for separating clustered object instances, which further boosts the segmentation performance. Our method ranked the first in two histological object segmentation challenges, including 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge and 2015 MICCAI Nuclei Segmentation Challenge. Extensive experiments on these two challenging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, surpassing all the other methods by a significant margin.},

abstract = {3D reconstructions of the spine from a frontal and sagittal radiographs is extremely challenging. The overlying features of soft tissues and air cavities interfere with image processing. It is also difficult to obtain information that is accurate enough to reconstruct complete 3D models. To overcome these problems, the proposed method efficiently combines the partial information contained in two images from a patient with a statistical 3D spine model generated from a database of scoliotic patients. The algorithm operates through two simultaneous iterating processes. The first one generates a personalized vertebra model using a 2D/3D registration process with bone boundaries extracted from radiographs, while the other one infers the position and the shape of other vertebrae from the current estimation of the registration process using a statistical 3D model. Experimental evaluations have shown good performances of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to CT-scan.},

abstract = {Quantitative measurements of spine shape parameters on planar X-rays is critical for clinical applications, but remains tedious and with no fully automated solution demonstrated on the whole spine. This study aims to limit manual input, while demonstrating precise vertebrae corners positioning and shape parameter measurements from sagittal radiographs of the cervical and lumbar regions, exploiting novel dedicated visual features and specialised classifiers. A database of manually annotated X-rays is used to train specialised Random Forest classifiers for each spine region and corner type. An original combination of local gradient characteristics, Haar-like features and contextual features based on patch intensity and contrast is used as visual features. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on 109 sagittal X-rays of asymptomatic and pathological subjects, from multiple imaging sites, and with a large age range (6-69 years old). Performance is first evaluated for positioning a 2D spine shape model, where precisely detected corners enable to adjust the model via an original multilinear statistical regression. Root-mean-square errors of corners localisation and vertebra orientations are reported, demonstrating state-of-the-art precision compared to existing methods, but with minimal manual input. The method is then evaluated for the extraction of additional vertebrae shape characteristics, such as vertebral centre positioning, endplate centres positioning and endplate length measures, rarely studied in previous literature. The proposed method enables, with minimal initialisation, fast and precise individual vertebrae delineations on sagittal radiographs of normal and pathological cases, with a precision and robustness level required for objective support for diagnosis and therapy decision-making.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group},

abstract = {PURPOSE To describe and categorize diagnostic errors in cervical spine CT (CsCT) interpretation performed for trauma and to assess their clinical significance. METHODS All CsCTs performed for trauma with diagnostic errors that came to our attention based on clinical or imaging follow-up or quality assurance peer review from 2004 to 2017 were included. The number of CsCTs performed at our institution during the same time interval was calculated. Errors were categorized as spinal/extraspinal, involving osseous/soft tissue structures, by anatomical site and level. Images were reviewed by a radiologist and two spine surgeons. For each error, the need for surgery, immobilization, CT angiogram of the neck, and MRI was assessed; if any of these were needed, the error was considered clinically significant. RESULTS Of an approximate total 59,000 CsCTs, 56 reports containing diagnostic errors were included. Twelve were extraspinal, and 44 were spinal (26 fractures, 15 intervertebral disc protrusions, two subluxations, one lytic bone lesion). The most common sites of spinal fractures were vertebral body (n = 10) and transverse process (n = 8); the most common levels were C5 (n = 8) and C7 (n = 6). All (n = 26) fractures and two atlantooccipital subluxations were considered clinically significant, including three patients who would have required urgent surgical stabilization (two subluxations and one facet fracture). Two transverse processes fractures did not alter the need for surgical intervention/surgical approach, immobilization, or MRI. CONCLUSIONS In our study, 66{\%} of spinal diagnostic errors on CsCT were considered clinically significant, potentially altering clinical management. Transverse process and vertebral body fractures were commonly missed.},

No assumptions are made about which section of the spine is visible or to which extent. Thus, our approach is more general than previous work while being computationally efficient. Our algorithm is based on regression forests and probabilistic graphical models. The discriminative, regression part aims at roughly detecting the visible part of the spine. Accurate localization and identification of individual vertebrae is achieved through a generative model capturing spinal shape and appearance. The system is evaluated quantitatively on 200 CT scans, the largest dataset reported for this purpose. We obtain an overall median localization error of less than 6mm, with an identification rate of 81{\%}.},

abstract = {Accurate localization and identification of vertebrae in spinal imaging is crucial for the clinical tasks of diagnosis, surgical planning, and post-operative assessment. The main difficulties for automatic methods arise from the frequent presence of abnormal spine curvature, small field of view, and image artifacts caused by surgical implants. Many previous methods rely on parametric models of appearance and shape whose performance can substantially degrade for pathological cases. We propose a robust localization and identification algorithm which builds upon supervised classification forests and avoids an explicit parametric model of appearance. We overcome the tedious requirement for dense annotations by a semi-automatic labeling strategy. Sparse centroid annotations are transformed into dense probabilistic labels which capture the inherent identification uncertainty. Using the dense labels, we learn a discriminative centroid classifier based on local and contextual intensity features which is robust to typical characteristics of spinal pathologies and image artifacts. Extensive evaluation is performed on a challenging dataset of 224 spine CT scans of patients with varying pathologies including high-grade scoliosis, kyphosis, and presence of surgical implants. Additionally, we test our method on a heterogeneous dataset of another 200, mostly abdominal, CTs. Quantitative evaluation is carried out with respect to localization errors and identification rates, and compared to a recently proposed method. Our approach is efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art on pathological cases.},

However, such methods require an important reconstruction time and there is a clinical need for fast and accurate techniques. This study proposes and evaluates a novel reconstruction method of the spine from biplanar X-rays. The approach uses parametric models based on longitudinal and transversal inferences. A first reconstruction level, dedicated to routine clinical use, allows to get a fast estimate (reconstruction time: 2 min 30 s) of the 3D reconstruction and accurate clinical measurements. The clinical measurements precision (evaluated on asymptomatic subjects, moderate and severe scolioses) was between 1.2° and 5.6°. For a more accurate 3D reconstruction (complex pathologies or research purposes), a second reconstruction level can be obtained within a reduced reconstruction time (10 min) with a fine adjustment of the 3D models. The mean shape accuracy in comparison with CT-scan was 1.0 mm. The 3D reconstruction method precision was 1.8 mm for the vertebrae position and between 2.3° and 3.9° for the orientation. With a reduced reconstruction time, an improved accuracy and precision and a method proposing two reconstruction levels, this approach is efficient for both clinical routine uses and research purposes. {\textcopyright} 2009 IPEM.},

The perpective of this work is to segment the vertebrae on X-Ray images for the analysis of the vertebral mobility. In previoux work, we proposed a segmentation technique based on Active Shape Model. The extraction and the detection of the vertebra corners can contribute to the automatic initialization of the Active Shape Model search and can give valuable information about the spine curvature. Here, we present the benefits of the polygonal approximation dedicated to the points of interest detection. The methodology developed here is composed of 3 stages : a contrast limited adaptative histogram equalization, a Canny edge detection filter and an edge polygonal approximation. The first histogram equalization step is a pretraitment needed to improve the image quality in order to perform a better contour detection. The Canny operator detects the edges in the radiograph which are used as an input to the polygonal approximation. The edges become segment lines whose intersections define corners. We compare the results obtained with our approach based on the polygonal approximation to results coming from the Harris corner detector.},

abstract = {Automatically detecting vertebral bodies in X-Ray images is a very complex task, especially because of the noise and the low contrast resulting in that kind of medical imagery modality. Therefore, the contributions in the literature are mainly interested in only 2 medical imagery modalities: Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR). Few works are dedicated to the conventional X-Ray radiography and propose mostly semi-automaticmethods. However, vertebra detection is a key step in manymedical applications such as vertebra segmentation, vertebral morphometry, etc. In this work, we develop a fully automatic approach for the vertebra detection, based on a learning method. The idea is to detect a vertebra by its anterior corners without human intervention. To this end, the points of interest in the radiograph are firstly detected by an edge polygonal approximation. Then, a SIFT descriptor is used to train an SVM-model. Therefore, each point of interest can be classified in order to detect if it belongs to a vertebra or not. Our approach has been assessed by the detection of 250 cervical vertebr{\ae} on radiographs. The results show a very high precision with a corner detection rate of 90.4{\%} and a vertebra detection rate from 81.6{\%} to 86.5{\%}.},

abstract = {Algorithms based on the local description of interest regions are well adapted to the task of detecting and matching equivalent points between two images. Classical descriptors such as SIFT or SURF are efficient when applied to regular images with rich information. When it comes to medical images, these algorithms are not longer applicable without adaptation. For this reason, we propose in this paper a feature-based framework for the detection of objects in medical images with poor information (e.g. X-Ray images). Our approach is based on a modified version of SURF. In order to illustrate our purpose, we apply our framework to the cervical vertebra detection on X-Ray images. The results show that this modified descriptor is an efficient solution in the medical domain. It allows to properly process the vertebra detection in better computing times than other classical descriptors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Conventional X-Rayradiography remain nowadays the most common method to analyze spinal mobility in two dimensions. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a framework dedicated to the fully automatic cervical spine mobility analysis on X-Ray images. To this aim, we propose an approach based on the three main steps: fully automatic vertebra detection, vertebra segmentation and angular measurement. The accuracy of the method was assessed for a total of 245 vertebrae. For the vertebrae detection, we proposed an adapted version of two descriptors, namely Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), coupled with a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Vertebrae are successfully detected in 89.8{\%} of cases and it is demonstrated that SURF slightly outperforms SIFT. The Active Shape Model approach was considered as a segmentation procedure. We observed that a statistical shape model specific to the vertebral level improves the results. Angular errors of cervical spine mobility are presented. We showed that these errors remain within the inter-operator variability of the reference method.},

abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20{\%} relative improvement to 62.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {Assessment of the cervical spine using X-ray radiography is an important task when providing emergency room care to trauma patients suspected of a cervical spine injury. In routine clinical practice, a physician will inspect the alignment of the cervical spine vertebrae by mentally tracing three alignment curves along the anterior and posterior sides of the cervical vertebral bodies, as well as one along the spinolaminar junction. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to semi-automatically delineate the spinolaminar junction curve, given a single reference point and the corners of each vertebral body. From the reference point, our method extracts a region of interest, and performs template matching using normalized cross-correlation to find matching regions along the spinolaminar junction. Matching points are then fit to a third order spline, producing an interpolating curve. Experimental results demonstrate promising results, on average producing a modified Hausdorff distance of 1.8 mm, validated on a dataset consisting of 29 patients including those with degenerative change, retrolisthesis, and fracture.},

abstract = {Correct diagnosis of cervical spine injuries is still a common problem in traumatology. The incidence of delayed diagnosis ranges from 5 to 20{\%}. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and reasons for delayed or missed diagnosis at this Level I trauma unit and to provide recommendations for optimal examination of patients with suspected cervical spine injuries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Analysis of clinical records showed 367 patients with cervical spine injuries who were admitted to this trauma department between 1980 and 2000. In all, 140 patients had an injury of the upper cervical spine (C1/C2), 212 patients had an injury of the lower cervical spine (C3-C7), and 15 patients had a combined injury of the upper and lower cervical spine.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The diagnostic failure rate was 4.9{\%} (n = 18). Results showed several profound reasons for missed or delayed diagnosis. In eight patients (44{\%}), radiologic misinterpretation was responsible for delay in diagnosis; in five patients (28{\%}), incomplete sets of radiographs were responsible. In four cases (22{\%}), the injury was missed because inadequate radiographs did not show the level of the injury; in one case (6{\%}), the treating surgeon did not see the radiographs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: For optimal examination of patients with suspected cervical spine injuries, we recommend establishing specific diagnostic algorithms including complete sets of proper radiographs with functional flexion/extension views, secondary evaluation of the radiographs by experienced staff, and further radiologic examinations (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) if evaluation of standard views is difficult.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {Automatic vertebrae localization and identification in medical computed tomography (CT) scans is of great value for computer-aided spine diseases diagnosis. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the approaches employing hand-crafted, low-level features and based on field-of-view priori assumption of spine structure, an automatic method is proposed to localize and identify vertebrae by combining deep stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) contextual features and structured regression forest (SRF). The method employs SSAE to learn image deep contextual features instead of hand-crafted ones by building larger-range input samples to improve their contextual discrimination ability. In the localization and identification stage, it incorporates the SRF model to achieve whole spine localization, then screens those vertebrae within the image, thus relieves the assumption that the part of spine in the field of image is visible. In the end, the output distribution of SRF and spine CT scans properties are assembled to develop a two-stage progressive refining strategy, where the mean-shift kernel density estimation and Otsu method instead of Markov random field (MRF) are adopted to reduce model complexity and refine vertebrae localization results. Extensive evaluation was performed on a challenging data set of 98 spine CT scans. Compared with the hidden Markov model and the method based on convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed approach could effectively and automatically locate and identify spinal targets in CT scans, and achieve higher localization accuracy, low model complexity, and no need for any assumptions about visual field in CT scans.},
